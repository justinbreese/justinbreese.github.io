We live in a constantly communicating society.  We have posts, tweets, blogs (thanks for reading), snapchats, and updates.  Try leaving your house without your phone and sheer panic not setting in – you’ll go back home to get it.

Because we are always connected we know when everything happens.

Sometime when I was in middle school or high school, I remember a time when I had to carry around a list of my friends home phone numbers or memorize a select few – I am talking about landlines here.  If I wanted to hang out with them after work, I had to find the nearest pay phone and call several different houses until I could figure out what we were going to do.

Not knowing was part of the mystery and it also helped turn the mundane into an adventure.
