Alright, I will say it: I love history.  It is inspiring to learn about what people have accomplished, how they have done it, the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I am not talking about the sugar-coated history either.  I love learning about the villains and the things that were left out of the high school history books.

If you are like me, then you need to listen to Hardcore History by Dan Carlin.  Dan and his team do a ton of research - often coming to the episode with 50+ sources.  He delivers each episode - and there fifty-five and counting - with a ton of energy and he keeps you engaged the whole time.

My personal favorites are his _Blueprint for Armageddon_ series.  They cover the years leading up, during, and after World War I.  There are six episodes in total and each episode is about 3 hours.  It may sound like a lot, but to me it was not enough.  I am definitely looking forward the extras episode that will come out in the future.
