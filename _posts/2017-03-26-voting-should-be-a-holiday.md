It just doesn't make sense. We get days off for dead presidents, a badass civil rights leader, honoring our Veterans, our independence, labor rights, when an explorer showed up to the Americas, time to gives thanks (read: eat turkey), and the birth of a major religious figure.  But, we don't celebrate the most concrete foundation of democracy; voting.

I am not debating the importance or lack thereof of the other holidays, I am just pointing out the fact that there is not a day off to vote.

If a man from Mars were to look on to us, he would think that we value dead presidents more than the maintenance of our democracy.
