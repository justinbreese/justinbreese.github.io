Alright, I love history. I love everything about it. It applies so much to our lives. I spent a lot of time listening to the _[History of Rome][historyRome]_ podcast and [wrote][blogLink] about it.

The _[History of Byzantium][byz]_ picks up where the _History of Rome_ left off. Robin Pierson takes you on the continuation of Romania and into - what we call - the Byzantine period. It truly is the story of the continuation of Rome but instead of starting with the Pagan-Republicans of the Roman Republic, it starts with the Christian-Imperialists of Constantinople.

Robin does an amazing job picking up the torch where Mike Duncan (_History of Rome_) left off. The journey of _The History of Byzantium_ goes until  1453 AD and the fall of Constantinople.

Each episode is done in a consumable length; not too long, not too short, around  ~30 minutes. There are currently 177 episodes and counting...

To sum it up: it is amazing to understand the dynamics of people that walked before us after hundreds of years; that is the time that it takes for objectivity to prevail and truly understand what happened. That is exactly what _The History of Byzantium_ is all about; no bullshit and to the point of what happened.

I cannot recommend it enough.
