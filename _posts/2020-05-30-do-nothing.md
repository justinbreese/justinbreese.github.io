Everywhere you look, you can see people with their heads down. You see their craned necks and their thumb swiping.

The Internet became a new medium for consumption. By doing it, we have removed the functionality that makes us human; adaptability.  As a society, we cannot stand even thirty seconds of nothing to do before we have to pull out our phones, turn on music or TV, etc.

We go to sleep next to our phones and we wake up and check our phones.

These devices teach us to consume. The Internet started as a means to share information.  It became prolific because we discovered that it was just another medium for consumption of goods and services.

Don't get me wrong, I love the Internet and all of the devices that we have, but within reason. I feel that we have gone too far. We have gotten detached from our roots. We are interacting less in the physical World.

# Challenge
*  Do nothing for 3 hours. Really, do absolutely nothing. Go to the woods, beach, etc. with nothing planned. Just figure out how to entertain yourself. In a weird way, I found it to be actually fun and relaxing. Don't look at your phone - don't even bring it with you. Just. Do. Nothing.
*  The next time that you are out to eat and someone leaves the table to use the restroom, don't look at your phone. Do nothing. Enjoy the time and space.

Now I am going to get back to doing nothing...

_This was mainly written pre-Covid when you could actually leave the house... but it still holds true._
