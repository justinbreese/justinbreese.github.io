I have worked from home for many years; being remote has been my way of life. What has always kept me sane is:

* Having my hobbies (I have way too many)
* Have a reasonably strict schedule/routine

Because of this, being home during this Covid crisis has not been that big of adjustment for me. I am very fortunate.

I have friends, colleagues, etc. who are all not adjusting well to this new way of life. Instead, they work more, are tired, stressed, etc. I hear things like, "I am home all of the time, I might as well work." No, you shouldn't be doing that to yourself.

Instead, get a hobby! Find something to do. Really, you can do anything! Learn an instrument, write, read, play a game... there are so many things that you can do.

Just. Do. Something. Your sanity will thank you.
