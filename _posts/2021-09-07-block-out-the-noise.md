I have an iPhone SE... not the new one, but the old one. The very old one. In fact, I was hanging out with my 6 year old niece a few weeks ago and she said, "You don't have a phone, you have an iPod." It is that old. It has turned into a joke whenever I am with friends, customers, etc. Some think it should be in a museum. I really love it. Why? 
* Form factor: it is small, it can fit anywhere
* Lack of performance: it is not fast. In fact, at times it can be frustratingly slow
* Small screen: I cannot use most apps because it requires way too much scrolling

So, if it is slow and I can barely use apps in it, why do I love it so much? Focus. With very few apps to annoy me, I can focus on being in the moment wherever I am and with whoever I am with. I can do the basics:

I remember my original Nokia brick phone, then the Motorola Razr, finally my first _smart_ phone in the HTC 7 Pro; it was super cool. I remember sideloading Android 1.6 on it. But, I digress... phones were a lot of fun. They were a hobby. Apps were fun and novel. 

Now, apps are noisy; they are all competing for your eyeballs. 

Get rid of notifications (e.g. email, slack, apps, etc.) - it doesn't matter
