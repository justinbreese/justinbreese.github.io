**You're a difference person each day, flat bench, and SVB** <br />
The following are a list of concise things that stuck out in my brain throughout the week:

Every single day, you are a different person than the day before. Everything you saw, heard, and experienced yesterday, changed you into the different person than you are today.

To target the pectoralis major the most effectively:
* Flat bench dumbbells
* Elbows at 45 degrees
* Dumbbells pronated 
* Wrists over elbows (the entire time)
* Flex through the movement

The big news of this week, in tech, was the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). A lot of startups and VC leverage this bank. 
* During Covid, their deposits went from ~$60B -> ~$180B
* They could not find enough loans for those depots so they bought some MBS (mortgage backed securities) that had 10 year yields at a low interest
* The Fed's interest rate went up, which caused the value of those low-yield MBS to become much less; as you can now buy 'risk-free' T-bonds at a much higher yield
* They sold some available for sale security and took a good sized loss (~$2B) and were raising more equity and debt to cover the loss
* ... which surprised investors as they [investors] thought that they had better liquidity than that
* This surprised/spooked investors and a subsequent run started on SVB
* In less than 48 hours, the second largest bank collapse - ever in the US - happened
