Hello world!

I am a technologist who currently lives in the LA area and grew up in Weedsport, NY.  I love any and all things technology.

I do not use any social media. Yes, I have all of the accounts, but no I do not use them at this time.

When I am not working, you can find me staying busy doing any and all of the following:

* Soccer
* Lifting weights
* Rock climbing
* Mountain biking
* Camping
* Backpacking
* Drums
* Guitar
* Brewing beer
* Coffee roasting (new to this)
* History (Roman Empire specifically)
